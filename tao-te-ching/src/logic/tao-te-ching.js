taoTeChing.ch_1 = `Tao (The Way) that can be spoken of is not the Constant Tao.\nThe name that can be named is not a Constant Name.\nNameless, is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the Mother of all things.\nThus, the constant void enables one to observe the true essence.\nThe constant being enables one to see the outward manifestations.\nThese two come paired from the same origin.\nBut when the essence is manifested,\nIt has a different name.\nThis same origin is called "The Profound Mystery."\n As profound the mystery as It can be,\nIt is the Gate to the essence of all life.`;
taoTeChing.ch_2 = `As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly.\nAs soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.\nTherefore being and non-being give birth to each other.\nDifficult and easy accomplish each other.\nLong and short form each other.\nHigh and low distinguish each other.\nSound and tone harmonize each other\nBefore and after follow each other as a sequence.\nRealizing this, the saint performs effortlessly according to the natural Way without personal desire, and practices the wordless teaching thru one's deeds.\nThe saint inspires the vitality of all lives, without holding back.\nHe nurtures all beings with no wish to take possession of.\nHe devotes all his energy but has no intention to hold on to the merit.\nWhen success is achieved, he seeks no recognition.\nBecause he does not claim for the credit, hence shall not lose it.`;
taoTeChing.ch_3 = `By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.\nBy not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.\nBy not seeing the desires of lust, one's heart will not be confused.\Therefore the governing of the saint is to empty one's mind, substantiate one's virtue, weaken one's worldly ambition and strengthen one's essence.\nHe lets the people to be innocent of worldly knowledge and desire, and keeps the clever ones from making trouble with their wits.\nActs naturally without desire, then everything will be accomplished in its natural order.`;
taoTeChing.ch_4 = `Tao (The Way) can be infused into the nature and put to use without being exhausted.\nIt is so deep and subtle like an abyss that is the origin of all things.\nIt is complete and perfect as a wholeness that can\n\tRound off sharp edges;\n\tHarmonize with the glory;\n\tAct in unity with the lowliness.\nTao is so profound and yet is invisible, It exists in everywhere and anywhere.\nI do not know whose Son It is, It existed before heaven and earth.`;
taoTeChing.ch_5 = `Nature nurtures all things with the wholeness of complete virtue.\nIt shows the greatest and perfect kindness by giving life to let all things grow and accomplish them with the hastening of harvests.\nTherefore, according to ancient custom, nature may seem unkind to regard all beings as a traditional straw dog for sacrifice.\nAnd likewise with a saint, he may seem unkind to regard people as a traditional straw dog for sacrifice.\nThe space between heaven and earth is like the bellows, it appears empty yet it gives a supply that never fails;\nThe more it moves, the more it brings forth.\nMany words lead to exhaustion.\nIt is better to center on the true essence within.`;
taoTeChing.ch_6 = `Spirit of the valley is immortal.\nIt is called the mystic nature.\nThe gate of the mystic nature is regarded as the root of the universe.\nIt is everlasting and cannot be consumed.`;
taoTeChing.ch_7 = `Heaven is everlasting and earth is enduring.\nThe reason that they are everlasting is because they do not exist for themselves\nHence, they are long lived.\nThus, although the saint puts himself last, finds himself in the lead.\nAlthough he is not self-concerned, finds himself accomplished.\nIt is because he is not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill his true nature.`;
taoTeChing.ch_8 = `A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.\nWater benefits all things and contends not with them.\nIt puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao.\nA virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place.\nHis mind is like the deep water that is calm and peaceful.\nHis heart is kind like water that benefits all.\nHis words are sincere like the constant flow of water.\nHis governing is natural without desire which is like the softness of water that penetrates through hard rocks.\nHis work is of talent like the free flow of water.\nHis movements is of right timing like water that flows smoothly\nA virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.`;
taoTeChing.ch_9 = `Those who overly pride wealth is like the overflowing water which shall cause damages. It is better to restrain early.\nThose who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.\nThe sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.\nWealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.\nThose who are arrogant of their wealth and fame shall invite blame upon oneself.\nThe nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one's success and not to hold on to the credit.`;

taoTeChing.ch_10 = `Can one unite the body and the spirit as one and embrace the "Oneness" without departing from the great Tao?\nCan one achieve harmony with such gentleness by holding on to the true spirit within as if the innocence of an infant?\nCan one free oneself from worldly knowledge and cleanse one's mind, so that no faults shall be made?\nCan a ruler love his people by governing with the natural Way without personal intention?\nCan the mystic gate to all life essence be opened or closed without the virtue of the mysterious nature?\nCan one gain the insight of nature and become a wise person without the effort of action?\nThe mysterious nature creates and nurtures all things without the desire to possess them.\nIt performs with all efforts without claiming for credit.\nIt flourishes all beings without the intention to take control of.\nSuch is the "Mystic Te" or "Mystic Virtue."`;
